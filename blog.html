                 hopes to talk to you once just hopes just last wordds i hv no more words to express as i am again inmpressive person so please be my my side 
                 The meaning of Himani is “Snow”.
                 Keep in mind that many names may have different meanings in other countries and languages, so be careful that the name that you choose doesn’t mean
                  something bad or unpleasant. Search comprehensively and find the name meaning of Himani and its name origin or of any other name in our database.

VIRTUAL ASSISTANT
In today’s era almost all tasks are digitalized. We have Smartphone in hands and it isnothing less than having world at your finger tips. These days we aren’t even using fingers.We just speak of the task and it is done. There exist systems where we can say Text Dad, “I’ll be late today.” And the text is sent. That is the task of a Virtual Assistant.
 
It also supportsspecialized task such as booking a flight, or finding cheapest book online from various e-commerce sites and then providing an interface to book an order are helping automate search,discovery and online order operations.
 
Virtual Assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks, suchas showing weather report, creating reminders, making shopping lists etc. They can takecommands via text (online chat bots) or by voice. Voice based intelligent assistants need aninvoking word or wake word to activate the listener, followed by the command. For my project the wake word is JIA. We have so many virtual assistants, such as Apple’s Siri,Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. For this project, wake word was chosen JIA.This system is designed to be used efficiently on desktops. Personal assistant softwareimproves user productivity by managing routine tasks of the user and by providinginformation from online sources to the user. JIA is effortless to use. Call the wake word ‘JIA’followed by the command. And within seconds, it gets executed.Voice searches have dominated over text search.

 Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. The basic logic gates include AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. They can be implemented in digital hardware using transistors and/or diodes. In a few applications, they are implemented using electromechanical relays, fluidics, pneumatics, or optical elements.
  A series of logic gates can be used to implement complex Boolean functions.
  AND produces a 0 output unless both the X and Y inputs are both 1, when the output is 1.
NAND is the negation of AND, it produces a 1 output unless both the X and Y inputs are both 1, when the output is 0.
OR produces a 0 output only when both the X and Y inputs are 0, otherwise the output is 1.
NOR is the negation of OR and produces a 1 output when both inputs are 0, otherwise the output is 0.
XOR is an exclusive OR and outputs 1 if there is only a single 1 input between X and Y, inputs of two 0s or two 1s produce an output of 0.
XNOR is the inverse of XOR and inputs of two 0s and two 1s will produce an output of 1, it produces an output of 0 if there is a single 1 input between X and Y.
NOT is also called an inverter; if the input is 1, the output is 0, and if the input is a 0 the output is 1.AND produces a 0 output unless both the X and Y inputs are both 1, when the output is 1.
