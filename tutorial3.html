       XOR is an exclusive OR and outputs 1 if there is only a single 1 input between X and Y,
        inputs of two 0s or two 1s produce an output of 0.
          XNOR is the inverse of XOR and inputs of two 0s and two 1s will 
          produce an output of 1, it produces an output of 0 if there is a single 1 input between X and Y.
    NOT is also called an inverter; if the input is
     1, the output is 0, and
     if the input is a 0 the output 
     is 1.AND produces a 0 output unles
     s both the X and Y inputs are both 1, when the output is 1.
    NAND is the negation of AND, it produces a 1 output unless both 
    the X and Y inputs are both 1, when the output is 0.
    OR produces a 0 output only when both the X and
     Y inputs are 0, otherwise the output is 1.
